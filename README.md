My Process

- Built with
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Custom Properties (variables)
- CSS Grid & Flexbox

What I learned

In this project, I practiced:

- Centering elements using place-content: center
- Positioning decorative images with position: absolute
- Creating a profile layout using flex and grid
- Using border-radius and overflow: hidden for rounded UI elements
- Continued Development

Going forward, Iâ€™d like to:

Add interactivity with basic JavaScript
Make the design responsive for smaller screen sizes
Explore animations when hovering over stats or the avatar
